# Chat with Documents using Llama-3.2

This project demonstrates how to process and interact with PDF documents using a conversational AI model, **Llama-3.2**. The solution uses embeddings, vector storage, and custom prompt engineering to enable users to upload documents, extract context, and receive answers to queries related to the document content.

- ## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Enable users to ask questions about PDF documents and receive relevant, concise answers.
- **Features**:
  - Upload and process PDF files.
  - Create vector-based embeddings of document content for efficient querying.
  - Use custom prompt engineering for clear and context-relevant responses.
  - Runs entirely within a Jupyter Notebook for ease of use and experimentation.

### **Core Libraries**
- **Llama-Index**: For building the query engine and managing document indexing.
- **HuggingFace Embedding**: To generate embeddings for efficient similarity-based searches.
- **PyPDF2**: To handle PDF file processing and text extraction.
